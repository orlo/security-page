# Security-overview

Built on top of a security page framework [here](https://www.sqreen.com/resources/security-page)

## Get started

How to run it locally:
```bash
npm install
//or
yarn install
```
And then
```bash
gulp
```
It will compile, minify the css and compress the javascript into `/build`.

## Easily deploy it with Netlify or Github pages
