# Orlo Sub Processors

Our customers range from SMB to enterprise organisations such as banks, government departments and police forces, all of which trust us with their data. Keeping our customers' data safe is our priority.

## Overview
Orlo uses certain sub-processors and content delivery networks to assist it in providing the Services.

## What is a Sub-processor
A sub-processor is a third party data processor engaged by Orlo, who has or potentially will have access to or process
Service Data (which may contain Personal Data). Orlo engages different types of sub-processors to perform various
functions as explained in the tables below.

## Due Diligence
Orlo uses a commercially reasonable selection process by which it evaluates the security, privacy and
confidentiality practices of proposed sub-processors that will or may have access to or otherwise process Service Data.


## Process to Engage New Sub-processors:
For all Subscribers who have executed Orlo’s standard DPA, Orlo will provide notice via this policy of updates to the
list of sub-processors that are utilized or which Orlo proposes to utilize to deliver its Services. Orlo will
keep this list updated regularly to enable its Subscribers to stay informed of the scope of sub-processing associated
with the Orlo's Services.
